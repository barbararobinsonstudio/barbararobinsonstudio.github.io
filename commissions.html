				<h2>The Power of the<br /><span>Portrait</span></h2>
				<h4>An Heirloom</h4>
				<p>An heirloom... A love letter to your child... An illustration from your heart... all these and more are what a portrait of your child can be.
				Powerful and primal, nothing is so basic, so stirring, so powerful to a parent than an image of their child’s face. From the moment we look into
				their eyes as newborns to watching them take their first steps, we are smitten. No landscape is as known to us as that of the face of our child.
				It is the most intimately scrutinized piece of terrain in our lives. And yet it is also very fragile. Childhood is but a fleeting moment.</p>
				<p>Barbara Robinson understands all of this. Being a mother herself knows the value you as a parent place on the image of your child. She would
				like the privilege of using her ability and translate it all into a beautiful drawing. </p>
				<h3 id="illustrate">Let Barbara illustrate<br />what is in your heart</h3>
				<p>Only you are familiar with that smile he makes when he’s discovered something new or the special way the light catches her face when she’s deep
				in thought. Feel free to discuss these things with Barbara in your collaborative attempt to create your one-of-a-kind portrait. You as the parent
				of the subject are an important part of the portrait process. Barbara is attempting to capture your child’s likeness as well as spirit and character
				and interpret it all into a successful rendering. To that end, your input is crucial from beginning, when Barbara takes the photos to when you take
				your portrait home.</p>
				<h3 id="moving">Few things are capable of<br />moving us as deeply as the<br />face of a loved one</h3>
				<h4>Let’s Get Started</h4>
				<p>Sitting for long hours is not required. Only a short photography session in the comfort of your home is necessary (preferably outside to use natural
				light). Barbara is equally comfortable drawing inanimate objects, so feel free to include a favorite toy in this session. Once the pictures are taken
				and shared with you online,  Barbara and you can discuss the photographs that the portrait will be based on. She will recommend which of the photographs
				will make a successful portrait. You will need to advise her about which photographs best capture your child’s personality.</p>
				<p>Once the photographs have been chosen, Barbara can begin the portrait. The portrait will be drawn on medium-toned, acid-free paper with colored pencils
				in a method known as “Trois crayons”. Finished pieces are generally 12” x 16”. Within a short time you will have your timeless piece.</p>
				<h4>All About the Artist</h4>
				<p>Barbara Robinson, professional graphic and fine artist has a B.A. in Fine Art from Thiel College in Greenville, PA. Her interest in portraiture started
				at the age of 10 and she never tires of recording someone’s image on paper with pencil. Out-going, warm and friendly, she is especially well-suited to drawing
				children since she has a daughter of her own. Her ever-burgeoning portfolio of Isobel drawings was a wonderful and unique way to catalog her daughter’s childhood.</p>
				<p>Besides copies of her work on this website Barbara has plenty of original work in her home and studio that she will be pleased to show you. There is also a
				ever-growing list of satisfied customers that you can consult.</p>
