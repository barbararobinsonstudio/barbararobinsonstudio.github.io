			<p id="biocopy">Barbara Robinson creates uniquely personal artwork that mines her psyche (and likeness)
			in an attempt to unify the disparate part of herself. Multitasking with the best of them,
			she juggles roles as artist, classical musician, wife and mother, feeling very strongly
			that all her roles in life show up one way or another in her artwork. Drawing portraits
			from a very young age, she still finds that staring into someone's face to record their
			likeness continues to fascinate and compel her. Graduating from Thiel College with a degree
			in Fine Art, Barbara went to work as a graphic artist, applying her artistic vision in the
			service of commerce. Never forgetting her roots as a fine artist, Barbara has always "kept
			her chops" by exhibiting her work in local galleries and submitting artwork to local, state
			and national juried competitions. While she has worked in various mediums (Ukrainian Easter Egg
			art, polymer clay), she returns consistently to pencil or colored pencil in her lifelong affair
			with line.</p>
